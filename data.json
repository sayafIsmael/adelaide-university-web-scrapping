An important learning outcome for students will be gaining knowledge on the intrinsic importance of country/land, the environment kin and identity for Indigenous people. Students may visit a key site on Kaurna country such as the cultural trail along the River Torrens. Students will also visit sites such as the South Australian Museum, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Mortlock Library or Tandanya Cultural Institute in order to assess, analyse and explore the differences and juxtaposition on how Indigenous Knowledges, relationships, cultures and people are represented by State institutions or Indigenous organisations. Indigenous elders, storytellers, performance and academics will teach students by providing knowledge of the Indigenous relationships and responsibilities that are intrinsic to successful communication and activities with Aboriginal people. Obtaining these skills will enhance their future employment in Indigenous sectors.","unitList":[{"code":"NA","title":"Indigenous People, Country &amp; Protocols","year":"2020","hours":null,"creditPoints":"NA","semester":[{"year":"2020","semester":"Semester 1","attendanceMode":"Internal","location":"North Terrace Campus","learningMethod":"NA"}],"sector":"Undergraduate","discipline":"ATSI Education: Wilto Yerlo","prerequisites":"NA","incompatible":"NA","assumedKnowledge":"NA","description":"This course provides a practical base for introducing students to the variety of Australian Aboriginal peoples, country and protocols.
